# fileManager
Repository storing a python program which will manage all downloaded files based on their extensions in my system.

# What it does
* The python script, when run, will make a folder for each of your file extension types, and put them in those folders respectively
* The automator script will watch your downloads folder, and after 60 seconds, will execute the python script. This gives you time to drag and drop the file to somewhere if you like.

# Setup
* This python script should be put into a folder of your choosing
* Take the automator script, and edit to your computer's file pathing, making sure to use absolute paths instead of relative ones
